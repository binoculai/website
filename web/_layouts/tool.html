    <h2>Welcome to Binoculai</h2>
    <p>
        Here's what you need to know about our Mail Search AI Google Workspace Addon and Google Chat app:
    </p>
    <h3>What we do with your data</h3>
    <p>
        Our apps access your Gmail data, process your email content and metadata, and create semantic embeddings. These
        embeddings are used to provide semantic search functionality across your Gmail. We save Gmail message IDs to
        fetch the content of your top search results when you conduct a search. We also collect usage information to
        understand usage patterns, manage subscriptions, and improve our services. Your data is never shared with any
        third-party services except for the OpenAI API.
    </p>
    <h3>Enhancing user functionality</h3>
    <p>
        Our apps significantly improve your Gmail experience by providing a robust semantic search functionality. You
        can conduct searches through our Gmail Addon or Google Chat app, and our system will fetch the most relevant
        results from your emails. We utilize the OpenAI API to process these results and deliver them to you in a
        natural language response.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using our apps, you are giving your explicit consent for us to use and share your data as described. If you
        have any questions, feel free to contact us at support@binoculai.top.
