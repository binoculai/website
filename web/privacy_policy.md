# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

We understand that your privacy is important to you and that you care about how your personal data is used and shared online. We respect and value the privacy of everyone who uses our Mail Search AI Google Workspace Addon ("Our App") and will only collect and use personal data in ways that are described here, and in a manner that is consistent with our obligations and your rights under the law.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and ensure that you understand it. Your acceptance of our Privacy Policy is deemed to occur upon your first use of Our App and upon accepting the permissions that Our App requests. If you do not accept and agree with this Privacy Policy, you must stop using Our App immediately.

## Information About Us

Our App is provided by Binoculai, a company dedicated to providing this Google Workspace Gmail Addon. For all correspondence, you may contact us through email at support@binoculai.top .

## Scope - What Does This Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy applies to your use of Our App and our website binoculai.top . It does not extend to any websites that are linked to from Our App or our website (including data we share with third-party applications). We have no control over how your data is collected, stored, or used by other websites and we advise you to check the privacy policies of any such websites before providing any data to them.

## What Data Do We Collect?

To provide semantic search functionality across your entire Gmail box and to keep track of usage, we collect and process the following data:

- Semantic Embeddings: We access your Gmail data to process your email content and metadata and generate semantic embeddings. These embeddings, which are vectors of numbers and not sentences or words from your data, are indexed and stored to provide the semantic search functionality in your Gmail. These embeddings are created for every email in your Gmail box.

- Gmail Message IDs: Along with the semantic embeddings, we save Gmail message IDs. When you conduct a search, these message IDs allow us to fetch the actual content of the top search results, display them to you, and use them in conjunction with the OpenAI API to generate a natural language response.

- Usage Information: We collect non-user data such as your user ID, name, email, sign-up date, last search date, and usage count. This information helps us understand the usage patterns, limit usage, manage subscriptions and improve our services.

Please note that while email content and metadata are required to create the embeddings, this data is never saved in our database, but only processed to create the embeddings.

## How Do We Use Your Data and With Whom Do We Share It?

We use your data exclusively to provide semantic search functionality and improve our services. We do not use your data for any other purposes, nor do we share your data with any third-party services except for the OpenAI API which is detailed below.

- OpenAI API: We use the OpenAI API to process search results and provide natural language responses. According to OpenAI's privacy policy as of our last update, OpenAI does not use this data for any purpose. See https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies .

We disclose this usage and sharing of data within our application and require explicit user consent to initiate this process. You will be asked to grant permission for our application to access your data and to share it with the OpenAI API during the installation and first use of Our App. By granting this permission, you are giving your explicit consent for us to use and share your data as described.

## How and Where Do We Store Your Data?

We only keep your Gmail Message IDs, semantic embeddings, and usage information to provide the functionality of Our App

 and improve our services. These are stored securely in a vector database. All your data is stored and processed within the secure confines of Google's cloud infrastructure.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time (for example, if the law changes). Any changes will be immediately posted on our site and you will be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Privacy Policy on your first use of Our App following the alterations.
