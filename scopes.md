1. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
**Justification:** We use this scope to fetch users' profile information, particularly their names, to personalize their experience when interacting with Mail Search AI. This information helps us to provide a more individualized user interface and create a more engaging user experience. 
**Narrower Scope:** A narrower scope wouldn't be sufficient, as personalization and user recognition are crucial components of our service. The user's name, which is accessible from this scope, is necessary for the mentioned personalization.

2. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
**Justification:** We use this scope to identify users uniquely within our service. By obtaining a user's primary Google Account email address, we can keep track of usage patterns, such as when a user signed up, when they last conducted a search, and the total count of searches they made. This data aids us in continually improving our services.
**Narrower Scope:** A narrower scope wouldn't be sufficient as the user's email is a unique identifier that allows us to tie usage data to specific users without storing personally identifiable information.

3. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request
**Justification:** 

   - https://k8es.ingest.binoculai.top/
   We require access to this URL to connect to our external vector database. This connection is crucial as it allows us to index and store the semantic embeddings, and retrieve them during the semantic search, which is a core functionality of our service.
   
   - https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions/
   Access to this URL enables us to connect to the OpenAI API service. This connection allows us to process the search results and generate natural language responses, enhancing the search functionality provided by our service.
   
**Narrower Scope:** There isn't a narrower scope that would provide us with the required functionality, as these permissions are necessary to make any external HTTP requests to the OpenAI API and our vector database.

4. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.execute
**Justification:** This scope is necessary for the core functionality of our app as a Gmail add-on. It enables us to execute as an add-on in the Gmail client, allowing users to perform semantic searches directly within their Gmail interface.
**Narrower Scope:** A narrower scope wouldn't be sufficient, as this permission is necessary for the functioning of our add-on within Gmail.

5. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly
**Justification:** We use this scope to fetch the email content and metadata necessary for generating the semantic embeddings and providing search functionality across users' Gmail boxes. This access is essential to create embeddings for all the emails in a user's Gmail box, thereby allowing for a semantic search across the entire box. The Gmail message IDs associated with the embeddings also enable us to fetch the actual content of the top search results.
**Narrower Scope:** A narrower scope wouldn't be sufficient, as we require access to the content and metadata of all emails in a user's Gmail box to create semantic embeddings and provide comprehensive search results.
